## Personal information

> After school I was lost, who do I want to be and who do I see myself in the future? The choice was spontaneous, I went to a psychologist.
But after 2 years of study, I realized that this is not the profession to which I wanted to devote my life and it does not inspire me at all.
Around the same time, my husband started programming and soon found his first job.
At first, it was a completely incomprehensible topic for me, but over time it fascinated me more and more.
Until one moment I realized that I wanted to be a programmer. I really like the gamedev section, but at first I decided to learn the frontend.
My goal is to prepare myself for basic training in the JavaScript / Front-end Course. All this will bring me one step closer to my goal of becoming a programmer.

    let middleNumber = arr[indexMiddle];
    if (start > end) {
        return -1
    }
    if (n > middleNumber) {
        return binarySearch(n, arr, indexMiddle + 1, end)
    }
